# CollidingObjects
Different techniques to create a scene full of colliding objects &amp; check which technique can contain maximum object count
Goal is to Create as many particles as possible while trying to achieve highest frame rate.

### Description
Colliding Objects is a Project where Particles are spawn on the screen and and they move in random direction & They collide with eachother as well as with the boundries of the scene

- Used Unity Profiler to Optimize & improve Performance
- Used Patterns Like UpdateManager, Spatial Partition, Generic Singleton
- Used Concepts like Interface, Inheritance, Mannual Collision detection through AABB collision check
- also Calculated Framerate to show the performance.

### Screenshot
Object Count - 10000 <br>
Average FPS - 63
